# monkey-x package

This is a direct port from the TextMate package.
It includes syntax highlighting and snippets for
core language constructs and standard libraries.

If you want to use custom snippets, it's best to put them in your custom file.
Chose the Atom Menu, then Snippets and a file will open. The syntax for snippets is like the code below:


	".source.monkey"
		"DrawCircle":
			prefix: 'DrawCircle'
			body: 'DrawCircle(${1:x}, ${2:y}, ${3:radius})$0'
		"DrawRect":
			prefix: 'DrawRect'
			body: 'DrawRect(${1:x}, ${2:y}, ${3:width}, ${4:height})$0'
